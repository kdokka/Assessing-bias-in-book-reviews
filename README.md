# Assessing-bias-in-book-reviews

Book reviews are an integral and indispensable part of fostering engagement in the community of book lovers. 

But how unbiased or genuine are the reviews? Do the readers who post the reviews have a conscious or subconscious bias which influence them to write more positive/negative reviews. 

Platforms such as Goodreads and Amazon aggregate all the information and do not address the bias that may be inherent in the reviews. 

My product, a web extension, will address this issue and provide customized information to each user on his/her book of choice. It will take in reviews posted on multiple websites, segment text data based on incentives the reader may have had (e.g., free early or advanced copy) and provide a comparison of true unbiased v/s potentially biased reviews to the user. This product will enable the user to make a more informed choice on pursuing his/her interest in the book.
